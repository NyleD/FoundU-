# About
Created a cross-platform mobile app that gives directions to a sight impaired user to find a friend through binural sounds. Great for public places, to feel more independent, venture out and explore.

#### Open Sourced: 
Would love to get this out as quick as possible to really make an impact for the sight impaired Comminity
